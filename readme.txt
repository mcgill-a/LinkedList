The toolchain used to build the program is "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015"

To use the makefile, type into the console:
	"nmake all". This will run the commands "test" and "clean"
	"nmake test" This will only run the "test" command, allowing the program to be run from the console by typing 'test'
